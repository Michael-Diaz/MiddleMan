Compilation and Running happen in the same step with Python

Navigate to the directory with the code in it

Run "Python3 Middleman.py" (you may have to install python3)

Choose a recipient; someone you are mutual friends with

Choose whether to send a message or recieve one
	If sending, make sure only to use alphabetic characters (and spaces)
		Once done, choose whether to send another message or exit to the menu
	If recieving, messages from the sender should show up decrypted
		Use ctrl+c (keyboard interrupt) to exit to the menu

When done, use the menu to logout properly and shut down the program
